# CLS INFRA Training School: ExploreCor – Using Programmable Corpora in Computational Literary Studies

Vienna 10-14 June 2024

https://clsinfra.io/events/training-school/

This repository contains the teaching material used for the **DraCor-related sessions** of the CLS INFRA Training School: *ExploreCor – Using Programmable Corpora in Computational Literary Studies*.

The following sessions are covered by this material:

- Introduction to Programmable Corpora [Session 1]
- Corpora in CLS Research. User Perspectives [Session 2]
- Exploring Programmable Corpora (Focus: Network Analysis) [Session 5]
- Reproducibility in CLS Research [Session 6]
- Open Topics [Session 7]

## Setup of a Local DraCor Environment
You can setup a local DraCor infrastructure and run the provided Jupyter notebooks in your local Jupyter Lab instance. We provide a Docker Compose File that can be used to start the services. It is necessary to have Git and [Docker (Desktop)](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed. If you are working on Windows use the Windows [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.4) or any other shell that allows you to use UNIX commands on Windows to execute the commands below:

1. In your Terminal clone this repository with the command `git clone https://github.com/dracor-org/dracor-explorecor.git`. Alternatively you can [download](https://github.com/dracor-org/dracor-explorecor/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unpack the ZIP file. 
2. Change into the folder `dracor-explorecor` with the command `cd dracor-explorecor`
3. Use the command `docker compose up` to start the Docker container
4. Navigate to [http://localhost:8889](http://localhost:8889) to access your local Jupyter Lab instance containing the materials. A HTML version can be accessed at [http://localhost:9980](http://localhost:9980) .

If you encouter problems setting up your environment you can join us for virtual trouble shooting session before the Training School. Please refer to the E-Mail you recieved containing the the Zoom-Link. 

## Build a Jupyter Book (optional)
You can build a HTML version of the teaching materials: Inside the Docker Container (e.g. from a Terminal Tab in Jupyter Lab) navigate to the `notebooks` folder and build the book with `jupyter-book build .`. You will find a directory `_build` containing the HTML version in the `dracor-explorecor` folder on your machine.
