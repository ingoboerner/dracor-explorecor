## Description 
This session will first focus on Ezlinavis, a tool from the DraCor environment that facilitates the manual extraction of (co-occurrence) network data from novels and plays, movies or series. We will then use ready-made network data from DraCor and feed them into Gephi, the most popular network analysis tool in the Digital Humanities. We will visualise networks and discuss ways to improve our results. This includes the calculation of node-related network values. In the last part we will show ways of visualising and calculating network data with Python using the NetworkX library.
