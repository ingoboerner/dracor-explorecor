# 6. Reproducibility in CLS Research

**Wednesday, June 12th, 10:00 a.m. – 11:20 a.m.**

## Description 
As a result of the so-called "reproducibility crisis" making research repeatable has become a crucial topic in empirical and technical sciences. In CLS, there is still a shortage of both a culture of repetitive research and user-friendly technical solutions. In his talk Christof Schöch will introduce a theoretical framework to describe modes of repeating research in Digital Humanities. The presentation will be followed by a hands-on session demonstrating how to make research based on DraCor repeatable by stabilizing a whole research environment including code and data with the help of Docker.
