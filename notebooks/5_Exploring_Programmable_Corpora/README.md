## Description
A key component of Programmable Corpora is the research-driven API, which makes it particularly easy to retrieve and process corpus data that have been generated for specific research questions. The DraCor API was developed especially for the network analysis method.  In this session we will introduce the method of network analysis and present the DraCor API and its possibilities in detail.
