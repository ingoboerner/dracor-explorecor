## Description
For Computational Literary Studies, one research object has proven to be of particular relevance that hardly plays a role in traditional literary studies: the corpus. In this introduction to the “ExploreCor” Training School, we will firstly reflect on working with literary corpora; secondly, we will introduce DraCor as a collection of so-called "Programmable Corpora" and demonstrate their potential.
